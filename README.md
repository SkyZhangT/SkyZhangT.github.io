# Sky's Homepage

This is Tianyang's home page project. The goal of this project is not only construct a webpage that contains my resume or personal experiences, my LinkedIn page handled that well. Rather, this is a side project that allows me to share my enthusiasm in photography while trying build a interactive webpage and efficient backend file system.

## Project Planning

This project have multiple stages:<br>

1. Basic HTML/CSS practice. This stage is mainly for me to pickup HTML/CSS syntax and web design skills. (Finished)
   - index page. (Finished)
   - Resume/CV page (Finished)
2. (New) React JS and Material-UI learning and implementation. (In progress)
   - React is an amazing web-building tool. But I never touched it before. Material-UI provides robust API to more web elements.
   - After some research, I decided to re-build my resume and personal gallery using the ReactJS.
3. Backend file system. Including linux server setup and API design. (In progress)
   - file system for photos ( jpg files, > 10 Mb)
   - Database for admin login, texts along with photos.
   - (Optional 1) Maybe allowing myself to upload photos/texts from remote client with the admin account.
   - (Optional 2) Allow guests to share comments, or like the photos.
4. JS script that communicates with backend server. Front end of the photo sharing webpage.
   - Scroll-loading page. Dynamically loads new photo/text while client scrolling down. (Sort by Date?)

The backend code is in another repo <link>https://github.com/SkyZhangT/github.io-backend</link>. This repo only hosts the front-end part.
