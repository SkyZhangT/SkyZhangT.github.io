# Sky's Homepage
This is Tianyang's home page project. The goal of this project is not only construct a webpage that contains my resume or personal experiences, my LinkedIn page handled that well. Rather, this is a side project that allows me to share my enthusiasm in photography while trying build a interactive webpage and efficient backend file system.

# Project Planning
This project have multiple stages:<br>

1. Basic HTML/CSS practice. This stage is mainly for me to pickup HTML/CSS syntax and web design skills.
    * index page.
    * Resume/CV page
2. Backend file system. Including linux server setup and API design.
    * file system for photos ( jpg files, > 10 Mb)
    * Database for admin login, texts along with photos.
    * (Optional 1) Maybe allowing myself to upload photos/texts from remote client with the admin account. 
    * (Optional 2) Allow guests to share comments, or like the photos.
4. Webpage design on the front-end.
3. JS script that communicates with backend server. Front end of the photo sharing webpage.
    * Scroll-loading page. Dynamically loads new photo/text while client scrolling down. (Sort by Date?)

The backend code is in another repo. This repo only hosts front-end part.

# PS
I did not use any existing theme pack/tool. This project is purely for training myself on full-stack skills, HTML/CSS, and JS.
